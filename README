# Chesstory
Chess game with modular rules.
School project for IUT de Calais France.

Goal : Create a chess game which includes several variants and is really customizable.
Environment : Written in JAVA (SE-1.8)=> should be compatible for every OS !

What has been asked :
  - Chess game with graphic interface
  - Including historical variants
  - Allowing to choose for every pieces the move set and, if possible, recreate our own chess board.
  
What is already done :
  - 'Basic' chess game with functional castling, etc.
  - Graphic interface :
    * Visual hints like in case of check, accessible positions, etc
    * Chess board and colors are customizable
    * Browser view which includes :
      ~ Time travel (through the game only, sorry)
      ~ If you do this, to avoid time paradox, you must say that you want to do an action
    * Rules of the current game are displayed in the rules text area.
    * Beautiful set of themes are available !
    
  - Some buttons to select game type
  
  - Timer added, to avoid time paradox, one more time, it is better to stop it if you travel ...
  	-> One timer for each player, we can remove it if wanted
  
  - Some warnings are displayed when "dangerous" action are made (leaving the game for example).
  
  - When right clicking a piece, it displays its rules in the logs text area.
    
  - Save & Load :
    * Work every time, with every possible rules set.
    * Check if you did not try to cheat by changing the file.
    
  - Rules :
    * Pieces and moves rules are customizable really easily with a graphic interface
 
  - Save general parameters, witch stays in a file between utilizations of Chesstory
 
  - JDoc
    
What is in progress :
  - Fix one for all the problems of build, where to put the images, saves, and default saves (actually the .JAR won't work properly because of the sounds, they were removed for the last version)
  - Improve UI in all the program
  - Add some main parameters
  - Chesstory 2.0

What remains to do (not exhaustiv list) :
  - Add ways to custom rules like castling, prise-en-passant, size of chess board, custom the timer, toggle on/off graphic hints, etc
  - Little FEN UI setter
  - See if we can rotate the chess board (utopia)
