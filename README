# Chesstory
Mutliple Chess games, this is a school project.
Goal : Create a chess game which include several variants and is really customable.
Support : Written in JAVA => should be compatible for every OS !

What has been asked :
  - Chess game with graphic interface
  - Including historical variants
  - Allowing to chose for every pieces the move set and, if possible, recreate our own chess board.
  
What is already done :
  - 'Basic' chess game
  - Graphic interface :
    * Visual hints like in case of 'echec', accessible positions, etc
    * Chessboard and colors are customable
    * Browser view which includes :
      ~ Time travel (through the game only, sorry)
      ~ If you do this, to avoid time paradox, you must say that you want to do an action
    
  - Save & Load :
    * Work one commit every two
    
  - Rules :
    * Pieces and deplacement rules are customable really easily
    
What is in progress :
  - We are in a period where save & load feature do not work all the time (since we changed rules), so fix that.
  - Graphic interface to select rules
  - Do a (user-friendly) jdoc and put all the code in the same language

What remains to do (not exhaustiv list) :
  - Add a timer (one for each player (like real chess)) (we know the principe (new thread itout itout))
  - Add some beautiful and shiny color themes !
  - See if we can rotate the chessboard (utopia)
