# Chesstory
Mutliple Chess games, this is a school project.
Goal : Create a chess game which includes several variants and is really customizable.
Support : Written in JAVA (SE-1.8)=> should be compatible for every OS !

What has been asked :
  - Chess game with graphic interface
  - Including historical variants
  - Allowing to choose for every pieces the move set and, if possible, recreate our own chess board.
  
What is already done :
  - 'Basic' chess game with workful castling, etc.
  - Graphic interface :
    * Visual hints like in case of check, accessible positions, etc
    * Chess board and colors are customizable
    * Browser view which includes :
      ~ Time travel (through the game only, sorry)
      ~ If you do this, to avoid time paradox, you must say that you want to do an action
    * Rules of the current game are displayed in the rules text area.
    * Beautiful set of themes are available !
    
  - Some buttons to select game type
  
  - Timer added, to avoid time paradox, one more time, it is better to stop it if you travel ...
  	-> One timer for each player, we can remove it if wanted
  
  - Some warnings are displayed when "dangerous" action are made (leaving the game for example).
  
  - When right clicking a piece, it displays its rules in the logs text area.
    
  - Save & Load :
    * Work every time, with every possible rules set.
    * Check if you did not try to cheat by changing the file.
    
  - Rules :
    * Pieces and moves rules are customizable really easily with a graphic interface
    
What is in progress :
  - Fix one for all the problems of build, where to put the images, saves, and default saves (actually the .JAR won't work properly because of that)
  - Do a (user-friendly) jdoc and put all the code in the same language (only remains package Controller)
  

What remains to do (not exhaustiv list) :
  - Add ways to custom rules like castling, prise-en-passant, size of chess board, custom the timer, toggle on/off graphic hints, etc
  - Create Chesstory 2.0, which should be really abstract
  - Save parameters (for all games)
  - See if we can rotate the chess board (utopia)
